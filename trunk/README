Communication was sniffed using wireshark's usb capture,
with windows application running in virtualbox.

To program sets serial port speed to 921600. Unfortunately
speeds above 115200 aren't handled correctly by pl2303
driver (as of 2.6.39). You need to apply included patch
to the kernel to make it work (will be present in linux 3.1).

Program doesn't (yet) check crc of received data blocks, so
it's safer to download data twice, and check if they are
identical.
